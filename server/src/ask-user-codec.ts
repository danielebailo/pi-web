/**
 * The one place the web UI's structured-question protocol is translated.
 *
 * pi's extension UI sub-protocol has exactly four dialogs — `select`,
 * `confirm`, `input`, `editor` — and none of them carries a batch of questions,
 * option descriptions, multi-select or a free-form "other". dsh's
 * `ask_user_question` has all four, so the shape has to ride inside a field pi
 * already sends. This module owns that encoding: the `pi-web-simple` extension
 * in `extensions/ask-user.ts` writes the payload into a `select` title, and
 * everything downstream — this server, the browser, the transcript — sees the
 * decoded form instead.
 *
 * Keeping the translation here rather than in the browser is deliberate: the
 * server is already the authority on which dialogs are pending (`ui-requests`)
 * and already filters what reaches a web client (`UI_METHODS_FOR_WEB`), so the
 * browser gets a clean `method: "ask_user"` request and never learns that a
 * sentinel option or a prefixed title was involved.
 *
 * The extension keeps its own copy of the constants and the encoder in the
 * same shape, because it runs in the pi process and cannot import this file.
 * Both sides are covered by tests; the wire format is `v`-versioned so the two
 * can be changed one at a time.
