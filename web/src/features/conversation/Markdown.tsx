 * disclosure's open state all die with the old tree. Measured on the reference
 * verification: the chips were being remounted ~350ms after the transcript
 * settled, which is enough to lose a hover that had already started. Module
 * scope makes the types permanent, so a re-render reconciles instead of
 * replacing.

 * the file vocabulary, the streaming flag, the anchor nesting — which is what

 * Markdown renderer for assistant output and user turns. Fenced blocks go

 *
 * Two of its affordances come from the surrounding `FileRefProvider`, and both
 * are off without one: a link whose destination names a workspace file becomes a
 * chip that opens it in the right sidebar (rather than a new browser tab), and an
 * inline-code token the turn's vocabulary recognizes as a real file becomes one
 * too. dsh splits these the same way — the *spelling* is the renderer's, the
 * *vocabulary* belongs to the turn — and it is what lets this component stay a
 * plain renderer for its seven call sites, only one of which is a conversation.
 *
 * Both are disabled while the message streams. A half-written path is not a
 * reference yet, and the vocabulary an answer will end up mentioning is not
 * final, so a chip now would be a guess that a later chunk would have to
 * retract.
 *
 * `variant` chooses the rhythm, not the sizes: `message` (the default) is the
 * transcript's tight one, where a paragraph is one of many and air between them
 * only pushes the next message off screen, while `document` is dsh's own spacing
 * for a surface that shows a whole document at a column's width (the plan
 * preview).
 *
 * Memoized on `text`, which is the whole point during a stream: every delta
 * republishes the conversation view, and without this the *entire* transcript
 * would be re-parsed and re-rendered for each token — a settled answer four
 * screens up is the same string it was a moment ago, and re-deriving it can
 * only cost frames in the one moment the reader is watching output arrive.
